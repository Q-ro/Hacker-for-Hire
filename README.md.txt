## Synopsis

A simple "hacking" inspired game powered by unity and C# scripting, this started as a very simple homework "box shooter" developed for week 2 of Corsera's MOOC titled ["Introduction to Game Development"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-development/home/welcome), but I ended up adding more and more stuff to make it more interesting.

## Motivation

I just wanted to apply the concepts learned through the course to make the second "game" we developed a more pleasing experience, with a backstory and more fleshed out gameplay and mechanics.

## Installation

You can download the whole project as a zip, unzip it, and open it with unity, if you want to see the game in action, the "Build" folder contains a WebBuild, download the folder, and double click the html file, the browser will load the page and then load the game using unity web player (bear in mind, It may not work with chrome). You can see the project in action [here](http://q-ro.github.io/Solar-system-unity/).

## Disclaimer

I tried to make a very simple yet interesting story revolving around hacking (as understood by the mainstream) using a very simple "box shooter" game as it's base, I've play tested the game and I think everything works out as intended save for some missing sound effects that I'm working on creating but other than that I believe this is good enough for a first release/demo of what the game could be as well as a good showcase of my abilities as a game designer/developer.
